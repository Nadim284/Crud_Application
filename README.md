By adding this snippet to the "Getting Started" section, you will provide instructions for users to install all the dependencies before they can start using or developing your application.

Make sure that you have a `package.json` file with the necessary dependencies listed. If you're missing it or want to ensure it's set up correctly, you can generate one by running:

```bash
npm init -y
